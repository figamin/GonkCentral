# GonkCentral
A Java program to act as a "hub" for all things Algonquin, built with JavaFX 8 using Jsoup to parse html and the KSU Canvas API to fetch information
## Features
- See IPass information (student info, schedule, attendance, grades)
- Canvas information (grades over each term, list of peers, list of course assignments
## TODO
- Academic/Athletic/Club information (from ARHS Blackboard site)
- Arts information (from https://gonkarts.org)
- Harbringer integreation (getting articles)
- WARHS playback (former shows with Google Drive
## Future plans
- Eventual port to Android & IOS (sans Canvas features)
## Note:
Until the school gives proper OAuth acess, logging into Canvas requires users to manually generate OAuth tokens from the Canvas settings page.
